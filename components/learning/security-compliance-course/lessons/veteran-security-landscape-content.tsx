      <blockquote>
        SecureVets, founded by a former Navy cybersecurity specialist, provides security services to both government and
        private sector clients. When bidding on a DoD contract, they needed to achieve CMMC Level 3 certification.
        <br />
        <br />
        They leveraged their founder's military experience to implement a comprehensive security program that included:
        <ul>
          <li>Documented security policies based on military protocols</li>
          <li>Regular security training for all employees</li>
          <li>Secure MCP automation for handling sensitive data</li>
          <li>Comprehensive incident response planning</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        This approach not only helped them win the DoD contract but also became a competitive advantage when marketing
        to private sector clients concerned about security.
      </blockquote>
